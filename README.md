# Secure Notes API

A security-focused notes-taking REST API built with **FastAPI**, demonstrating secure user authentication, token handling, and protected CRUD operations. Designed as a backend project to showcase principles of secure software development and API-level threat prevention.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **FastAPI**
- **OAuth2 with Password (Bearer Token)**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
- **Bcrypt** (for password hashing)
- **SQLite** (for lightweight data storage)

---

## Features

### User Authentication
- User **Registration** and **Login** with hashed passwords
- **JWT Token** generation and expiration handling
- Authentication via **OAuth2 password flow**

### Secure Notes Management
- **CRUD operations** for personal notes
- Routes are protected ‚Äî only authenticated users can access their own notes

### Security Measures
- Passwords are stored securely with **bcrypt hashing**
- Token-based route protection with FastAPI‚Äôs dependency injection
- Prepared for **SQL Injection testing** and **auth bypass testing**
- All endpoints return appropriate **HTTP status codes**

## Security Testing (In Progress)

| Attack Type            | Tested With | Status                |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| SQL Injection          | Postman     | ‚úÖ Blocked by ORM      |
| JWT Tampering          | Postman/Burp Suite | ‚úÖ Invalid token rejected |
| Tokenless Access       | Postman     | ‚úÖ Access denied       |
| Forced Browsing        | Burp Suite  | ‚úÖ Access denied       |
| Expired Token Handling | Manual Test | üîÑ Planned             |
| CSRF                   | N/A (API only) | ‚ùå Not applicable  |

## Relevance to Security & Risk Roles

This project demonstrates:
- Secure backend design principles
- API-level access control
- Threat simulation and mitigation
- Real-world auth workflows using OAuth2 + JWT

---

## Screenshots (To be added)

- Postman requests with and without token
- Burp Suite scans for endpoint vulnerabilities
- Token decoding and expiry handling

---

## Future Enhancements

- Role-based access (RBAC)
- Token revocation & blacklist
- Docker support
- CI/CD integration for testing
- Database migration support via Alembic
